- General
    - How long does the complier run
        - don't show if silent mode is enabled

- Lexer
    x Lex Some More Characters (newlines and tabs)
    x Line, Column, Index information in token
    x Lex full numbers
    - Lex decimal numbers?
    - Create Lexer Test Strings File (not 1.erg etc... remove them)
    - Lex Strings
    - Comments
        - Single Line Comments (# or //?)
        - Nested Comments
    - Length of
        - Number Literals
        - String Literals
        - Identifiers
        - etc
    - Lexer Dump File (.lex)

- Parser
    - Create AST Node

- Performance
    - Optimize data structure alignment

- Testing Framework
    - Tests should be in code
    - Code to run through the compiler ought to be stored in files not 
        in the c++ code as strings etc.
    - Should provide an easy way to load the appropriate test by use of
        the number only
    - The Code should verify the results
    - The compiler results ought to be appropriately structured so that
        a test could analyse the result object to find
        - errors
        - warnings
        - anomolies in tokens, or ast that it is expecting to find et
        - should show success/failure for parsing
        - should allow access to bytecode etc
        - EVERYTHING that a test would need to verify behaviour 
    - All errors and warning ought to have numbers
        - W1003 - your not using a variable
        - E0001 - symbol not found
    - Should destinguish between lexical and parsing errors?

- Other
    - Asserts everywhere!
    - Determine OS at compile time? set OS_NIX, OS_WIN, OS_MAX or others
        appropriate to the platform being compiled for (or is that a bad idea?)

    - Coding Guidelines (choose a style)

    - Get rid of the debugging output behind a flag instead of compile time
        directive... dump to files in another directory to keep the output 
        nice and clean!

    - Shell scripts to build_debug and build_release... should execute
        required clang commandlines with the required -D DEBUG symbol for 
        debug, as well as including other optimizations etc...
        
        Maybe we should have the following scripts
        - debug - builds and executes GDB, all additional arguments are forwarded
        to the executable
        - build - builds. Can take debug|release as argument, default is debug
        all additional arguments are passed to the executable
        - run   - builds in debug mode and executes,
        all additional arguments are passed to the executable
        - test  - runs compiler tests (build in debug and --run-compiler-tests
        passed to the compiler

    - Create way to generate enum and string value mapping or function
        to return a string representation of the enum to avoid duplication
        
        Generic enum generation and string mapping function.
